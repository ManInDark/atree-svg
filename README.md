# atree - svg

This project was inspired by [anvaka/atree](https://github.com/anvaka/atree) which uses JavaScript to create a christmas tree. In contrast to that this project uses python to generate the necessary values which can then be used in any 2D drawing plane. Here I used the svg path element to generate the image. To generate an svg you simply have to run Cone.py and put the output into a .html file.

Additionally, this project might get expanded later on to allow it to show even more shapes, as the tree is just a Cone right now and the "Render Engine" supports theoretically all possible shapes, as long as one can generate the necessary 3D points for it.
